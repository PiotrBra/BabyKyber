# BabyKyber
## Overview
This project implements **Baby Kyber**, a simplified educational version of the CRYSTALS-Kyber post-quantum cryptographic scheme. The code operates over the polynomial ring $\mathbb{Z}_{17}[X]/(X^4+1)$ and demonstrates key generation, encryption, and decryption using lattice-based cryptography principles. The goal is to achieve a high success rate (~80%) while maintaining simplicity for learning purposes.
